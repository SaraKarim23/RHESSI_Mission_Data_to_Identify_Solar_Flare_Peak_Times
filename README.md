# RHESSI_Mission_Data_to_Identify_Solar_Flare_Peak_Times

   1. Data Import and Preprocessing:
        Imports data from a CSV file located in Google Drive.
        Converts date and time columns to datetime format.
        Scales relevant features using MinMaxScaler.
        Extracts time features from datetime columns.
        Defines input and output features for the LSTM model.

   2. LSTM Model Building and Training:
        Builds an LSTM model using Keras.
        Trains the model on the preprocessed data for 20 epochs, with a batch size of 64 and a 20% validation split.

   3. Peak Time Prediction:
        Defines a function predict_peak_time to predict the peak time of a solar flare based on user-provided input features.
        Uses the trained LSTM model to make predictions.

   4. Evaluation:
        Plots the training and validation loss and accuracy over epochs.
        Calculates the difference between predicted and actual values for each parameter.
        Prints the mean squared error (MSE), root mean squared error (RMSE), and accuracy.
        Creates a confusion matrix to visualize the performance of the model.

   5. Explanation:
        This code demonstrates the use of LSTM models for time series prediction in the context of solar flare data analysis.
        It provides a comprehensive solution for importing, preprocessing, training, evaluating, and using an LSTM model for peak time prediction.
